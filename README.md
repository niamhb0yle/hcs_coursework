## What is the project?
Our project is a simple password strength checker, which tests the usability features of adding emojis to a password. The app first prompts the user to create a password with the option of adding emojis, but with no rules on how the password should be created. Then the user is prompted with our strength checker, which doesn't allow the user to create a password until certain conditions (both regular strength checking conditions AND emoji related conditions) have been met.

## How to use
This is a lightweight react project, and is easy to download. Please fork or clone our repository, cd to the <b>nested</b> directory 'hcs_coursework', and run the following command:

```
npm install
```
Then, to run the app:
```
npm run dev
```

## Libraries used
Since this is a lightweight app, we only used one library in our app to allow the user to add emojis to their password. You can find the docs for the EmojiPicker library [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/emoji-picker-react)!
